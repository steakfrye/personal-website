          <h4>When I'm not coding--</h4> I'm probably spending
          time with my wife and son (with another on the way!). I do a lot
          of cooking, even making my own butter and nursing my sourdough starter.
          I pride myself in the things I do, and I like to educate myself in
          an array of crafts and keep my skills sharp.
